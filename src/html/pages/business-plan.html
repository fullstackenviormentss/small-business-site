    <h2 id="business-plan-1" >Use Census Bureau Data for Your Plan</h2>
    <p>We have a wealth of information that you can use to create the best business plan for your data-driven business.</p>
    <h3 id="business-plan-1a">Find your classification codes</h3>
    <p>The North American Identification Classification System (NAICS) is used by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to classify businesses. Identifying your code will help you gather the data for your type of business and help to clearly define the types of activities common to your type of business. Knowing your NAICS code is also useful for other federal, state, and local government filings.</p>

    <h3 id="business-plan-1b">Conduct market research</h3>
    <p>Identify market patterns to find opportunities and business risks. Data can help you find out more about your community’s employment, like how many people are employed or the average payroll per employee for similar businesses. With consumer spending data, you can also gather information about how potential customers spend their money. Understanding your market will set a strong foundation for your business plan.</p>

    <h3 id="business-plan-1c">Understand the competition</h3>
    <p>There are similar businesses in every community, so understanding your competition will help your business thrive. Discovering how many similar businesses exist in your area can help you identify an ideal location, where the ratio of customers to businesses is beneficial for you. Our data will help you create a plan that accounts for the competition</p>

    <h3 id="business-plan-1d">Identify your customers</h3>
    <p>Customers are the key to a successful business. Whether you are creating a family-friendly business or looking to cater to a certain cultural group, we have the resources you need to learn about potential customers in your market. Find information about your potential customers’ ages, median incomes, employment statuses, and more to help you reach the right people. </p>
    <p class="tip"></br>TIP: Use the filter tool in CBB to identify your target market. You may filter the population using any variable available in CBB to find the best customers for your business.</p>
    <p></br>If you’re conducting business-to-business transactions, we have resources that can help you identify your customers’ needs. You can discover information about the number of establishments, total revenues, and more in your area.</p>

    <h3 id="business-plan-1e">Find your suppliers</h3>
    <p>Any business needs supplies to operate. Discovering how many wholesalers or industry retailers exist nearby can help you determine if you'll have the proper resources necessary for your day-to-day operations.</p>
