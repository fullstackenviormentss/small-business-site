    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2 id="restaurant-1">Determine Your Restaurant Type</h2>
    <p>There are many types of restaurants to choose from, including casual dining, fast food, food trucks, pubs, and more. Choosing a restaurant type will help you with other business decisions — like finding your customers</p>
    
    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h2 id="restaurant-2">Find Your customers</h2>
    <p>Our data can help you find out how much your customers can afford to spend. To determine who your ideal customers may be, you will want to consider the following pieces of information:</p>

    <h3 id="restaurant-2a">Median household income</h3>
    <p>Knowing how much people make in a year will help you decide how to price your food and drinks. The more money people make through their income, the more they can afford to spend at your restaurant.</p>

    <h3 id="restaurant-2b">Consumer spending</h3>
    <p>Understand what types of products and services your potential customers are spending their money on by using our consumer spending data. To learn more about how much people spend on restaurants in a certain area, look for consumer spending patterns on dining out.</p>
    <p class="tip"></br>TIP: Look at consumer spending habits within restaurant-related industries. Many people dine out before going to a movie or show, or grab drinks before or after eating at a restaurant; so, you might want to consider the consumer spending patterns for alcoholic beverages and entertainment. </p>
    <p></br><a href="my-customers.html">Discover more information</a> about finding your customers.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h2 id="restaurant-3">Choose a location</h2>
    <p>Choosing the perfect location for your restaurant relies on knowing your customers as well as understanding your competitors and complementary businesses.</p>

    <h3 id="restaurant-3a">Competing businesses</h3>
    <p>Other restaurants in your area are your competition. A great location is an area that lacks restaurants or has enough customers to help your restaurant be successful. To understand the business landscape in a certain area, you will want to know how many customers each restaurant has on average. Our data point called “population per establishment” will help you determine if there is a need for more restaurants in your chosen area.</p>
    <p></br><a href="my-competitors.html">Find out more</a> about your competitors.</p>

    <h3 id="restaurant-3b">Complementary businesses</h3>
    <p>Businesses that may interest your target market but are not the same as your business are called complementary businesses. Establishing your restaurant near a complementary store may help boost your foot traffic since your customers are likely interested in similar goods or services.</p>
    <p></br>Businesses that complement your restaurant include, but are not limited to, bakeries, entertainment venues, and bars.</p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h2 id="restaurant-4">Write a business plan</h2>
    <p>Once you have figured out the foundational information for your restaurant and customers, it’s time to start a business plan.</p>
    <p></br>Writing a business plan will help you create a roadmap for your restaurant and establish guidelines for the next three to five years of operations. </p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <h2 id="restaurant-5">Apply for a loan</h2>
    <p>Banks and other small lenders will want to know about your restaurant’s target market and competitors. <a href="build-a-report.html">A Census Business Builder report</a> can help you make a case for your restaurant by providing a data benchmark, and it can also help you demonstrate the strength of your business plan</p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <h2 id="restaurant-6">Learn about Laws and Regulations</h2>
    <p>Every type of business has many laws and regulations to follow.
