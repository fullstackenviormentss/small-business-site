    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2 id="salon-1">Find Your Customers</h2>
    <p>Our data can help you find your ideal customers. To figure out your target customers, consider the following pieces of data:</p>
    <h3 id="salon-1a">Median household income</h3>
    <p>Consider the types of goods and services your customers can afford. If you are launching a high-end salon, you will want to find customers who can afford pricier services. On the other hand, if your salon will offer an affordable pricing structure, your potential customers’ income will not be as limiting of a factor. </p>
    <h3 id="salon-1b">Consumer spending</h3>
    <p>Curious about your potential customers’ spending trends? Consumer spending data can help you understand the types of goods and services on which people spend their money.</p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h2 id="salon-2">Choose a Location</h2>
    <p>Finding the right location for your salon relies on knowing your customers, competitors, and community. </p>

    <h3 id="salon-2a">Competing businesses</h3>
    <p>Knowing about other beauty salons in your area will help you determine if there is a need for more businesses like yours. Our statistic called “population per establishment” is a great data point to help you better understand the current market; the ratio helps you understand if there are enough customers to support another beauty salon in your selected location. </p>
    <p></br><a href="my-competitors.html">Learn more</a> about your competitors.</p>

    <h3 id="salon-2b">Complementary businesses </h3>
    <p>Businesses that could be of interest to your potential customers — but are not beauty salons — are complementary businesses. Launching your beauty salon near a complementary business can help attract people from your target market. Complementary businesses for beauty salons include nail salons and barber shops. .</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h2 id="salon-3">Write a Business Plan</h2>
    <p>If you haven’t started already, it’s time to write a data-driven business plan. Establishing a roadmap for your salon will help you attain your organizational and financial goals.</p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h2 id="salon-4">Apply for a Loan</h2>
    <p>Need help financing your salon? Banks and other small lenders will want to know more about your beauty salon’s market — including your customers and competitors. The <a href="build-a-report.html">Census Business Builder report</a> can serve as a benchmark for comparing your business plan and can also help you demonstrate the strength of your market.</p>
