    <h2 id="restaurant-1">Determine your restaurant type</h2>
    <p>There are many types of restaurants to choose from, including casual dining, fast food, food trucks, pubs, and more. Choosing a restaurant type will help you with other business decisions — like finding your customers.</p>
    

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h2 id="restaurant-2">Find your customers</h2>
    <p>Our data can help you find out how much your customers can afford to spend. To determine who your ideal customers may be, you’ll want to consider the following pieces of information:</p>

    <h3 id="restaurant-2a">Median Household Income</h3>
    <p>Knowing how much people make in a year will help you decide how to price your food and drinks. The more money people make through their income, the more they can afford to spend at your restaurant.</p>

    <h3 id="restaurant-2b">Consumer Spending</h3>
    <p>Understand what types of products and services your potential customers are spending their money on by using our consumer spending data. To learn more about how much people spend on restaurants in a certain area, look for consumer spending patterns on dining out.</p>
    <p class="tip"></br>TIP: Look at consumer spending habits within restaurant-related industries. Many people dine out before going to a movie or show, or grab drinks before or after eating at a restaurant; so, you might want to consider the consumer spending patterns for alcoholic beverages and entertainment.</p>
