    <h2 id="location-1">Use Data to Determine the Best Location for Your Business
</h2>
    <p>There are many business location factors to consider when looking for the perfect place for your storefront. Census Business Builder (CBB) is a one-stop resource to help you start your research so that you can find the right location for your business.  </p>
    <h3 id="location-1a">Look for your customers</h3>
    <p>When considering a location, you will want to check that the nearby population fits your ideal customer profile. How much do people earn in the city you are considering? Do they spend money within your industry? Factors to consider include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Average age</li>
      <li>Median household income</li>
      <li>Consumer spending</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="my-customers.html">Discover our customer-related data</a> and learn how to apply it to your business.</p>
    <p>TIP: CBB data only goes down to the census tract level. If you are looking for data about a block group, check information from the American Community Survey or one of the decennial censuses.</p>
    
    <h3 id="location-1b">Find your competitors</h3>
    <p>Before you set up shop, you need to find out more about other similar businesses in your area. Consider the average revenue for your industry and how much each business pays its employees. Using Census Bureau economic data will help you determine if a certain location will fit your financial goals. Consider the following pieces of data:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of businesses</li>
      <ul>
        <li>How many competitors you have</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Population per business</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The number of people that each existing business serves </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Average payroll per employee</li>
      <ul>
        <li>How much you should expect to pay your employees  </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Average revenue per employee</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The revenue that each employee earns for your business </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Average revenue per dollar of payroll</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The amount of revenue that each employee earns for every dollar of payroll that you pay them </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="my-competitors.html">Learn more about your competitors</a> so you can account for the competition.</p>

  <h3 id="location-1c">Discover complementary businesses</h3>
    <p>Businesses that do not offer the same services as you, but may be useful to your target market, are complementary businesses. Proximity to these types of businesses may help boost your traffic, as your customers are likely looking for their services as well as those offered at your business. Look at the following pieces of data to find businesses near you:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of businesses</li>
      <ul>
        <li>How many complementary businesses exist in your area </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Population per business</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The number of your potential customers that complementary businesses currently serve </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
