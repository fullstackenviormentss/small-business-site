    <h2 id="report-1">About Reports</h2>
    <p>CBB assembles demographic, business, and consumer spending data that you can implement in your research. You can export CBB data into a report that includes interactive charts, which are usable in presentations, applications, and more.  You can also download and print your reports in CSV, Excel, and PDF formats.  </p>
    
    <h2 id="report-2">Benefits of a Report</h2>
    <h3 id="report-2a">Create a data-driven business plan</h3>
    <p>If you’re working on your business plan, you’ll want to have data about your customers, competitors, and suppliers. The reports provide an easy way to see all of the relevant data in one place.  </p>
    <h3 id="report-2b">Apply for a loan</h3>
    <p>Banks and other small business lenders want to know more about your market – including information about your potential customers and competitors. CBB reports can help you document the strength of your market, and can serve as a benchmark for comparing your business with similar ones in your area.  </p>
